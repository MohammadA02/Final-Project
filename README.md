# Final-Project

This project was very difficult, and it showed how hard coding truly can be. I really think it was very satisfying when I finally finished with the program. It's not exactly what I wanted since I definately could have made it a bit better, but I couldn't figure some things out in time. It took a lot of research and time to make what I got as of now, and I'm pretty happy with it.
